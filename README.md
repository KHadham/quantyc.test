# User List App

A simple Android application that fetches a list of users from a public API and displays them on the screen. This project demonstrates modern Android development practices using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and the MVVM architecture.

## ‚ú® Features

* Fetches user data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) API.
* Displays a list of users with their names and emails.
* Shows a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
* Displays an error message if the network request fails.
* Follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Kotlin:** The primary programming language.
* **Jetpack Compose:** For building the user interface declaratively.
* **Retrofit:** A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests.
* **Kotlin Coroutines:** For managing asynchronous operations.
* **Android ViewModel:** To store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
* **Gradle:** For dependency management.
